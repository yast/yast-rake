# Developed for yast project, however tries to be as generic as possible.
#
# Glossary:
# When rake command has format of sequence of words delimited by colon such as
# word1:word2:word3:... or word1 then
# - top level command is word1 from the above examples
# - sub command is any other word than word1
# - command is top level command together with zero or more sub commands
#
# TODO:
# - turn rake cache into an array, get rid of greping in _rake* functions
#   do array filtering instead and put result directly into COMPREPLY
# - do not cache "rake " prefix at the begining of each line produced by 'rake -T'
# - disable completetion when command is complete (currently it sometimes repeats
# - last completed word)
#
